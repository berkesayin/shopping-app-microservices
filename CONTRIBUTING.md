The `shopping app` is designed using `Microservices` architecture and `API Gateway` pattern.

`iyipay-java` API client developed by `iyzico` is integrated and used for the project at the `payment` service.

And `Elastic's sample eCommerce data` is used for `orders`, `products` and `search` functionalities.

Refer to the [Documentation](https://github.com/berkesayin/shopping-app-microservices/blob/master/README.md) section to setup and run project.
